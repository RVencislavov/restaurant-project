# Team - 6
## _Restaurant Project_
To Do List:

1) ако клиентът няма пари - вземат му каквото има и го изхвърлят
2) да зареждат склада в края на деня
3) да работи за повече от 1 ден

## Features we created

- Staff.
- Waiters.
- Chefs.
- Storage.
- Menu full of items.
- Upon starting the program we print out the whole menu.
- Clients can order from the menu we created.
- The program can take orders from the tables full of people.
- The chef can cook your meals by taking products out of the storage full of products.
- Although if we ran out of product which we needed for the following order we make sure the client cannot order this exact product and he should order somthing else.
- If there's no products for any of the following items from the menu our client would not be able to order from that type of items.
- The project have also a random tip generator for our clients.
- The waitresses can take the bill from the client.
- When the restaurant closes we print the most and least ordered products we had ,and remove the   least ordered product from the menu. We also check the turnover money we made.
